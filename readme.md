```

# Auth-Framework Specifications

The backend for a users directory website. All of the functionality below are fully implmented in this project.

### Users & Authentication

- Authentication will be ton using JWT/cookies
  - JWT and cookie should expire in 30 days
- User registration
  - Register as a "user" or "publisher"
  - Once registered, a token will be sent along with a cookie (token = xxx)
  - Passwords must be hashed
- User login
  - User can login with email and password
  - Plain text password will compare with stored hashed password
  - Once logged in, a token will be sent along with a cookie (token = xxx)
- User logout
  - Cookie will be sent to set token = none
- Get user
  - Route to get the currently logged in user (via token)
- Password reset (lost password)
  - User can request to reset password
  - A hashed token will be emailed to the users registered email address
  - A put request can be made to the generated url to reset password
  - The token will expire after 10 minutes
- Update user info
  - Authenticated user only
  - Separate route to update password
- User CRUD
  - Admin only
- Users can only be made admin by updating the database field manually

## Security

- Encrypt passwords and reset tokens
- Prevent NoSQL injections
- Add headers for security (helmet)
- Prevent cross site scripting - XSS
- Add a rate limit for requests of 100 requests per 10 minutes
- Protect against http param polution
- Use cors to make API public (for now)

## Code Related Suggestions / Refactoring

- NPM scripts for dev and production env
- Config file for important constants
- Use controller methods with documented descriptions/routes
- Error handling middleware
- Authentication middleware for protecting routes and setting user roles
- Validation using Mongoose and no external libraries
- Use async/await (create middleware to clean up controller methods)
- Create a database seeder to import and destroy data
